    <h3 class='title', id='beef'>beef</h3>
    <p>In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them.
         Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically
          for the quality or quantity of their meat. 
          Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world,
           after pork and poultry. 
           As of 2018, the United States, Brazil 
           and China were the largest producers of beef.
           Beef dishes are often nostalgic. 
           Whether it's a cultural classic like steak frites that will
            transport you to France, Mom's secret meat loaf recipe, 
            or a hearty stew you grew up with, beef plays a pretty large role
             in countless cuisines. While you can gussy up the meat 
             with a lavish sauce or seasoning, one factor remains 
             consistentâ€”the quality of the cut.
             Shepherd's Pie
             "Ground beef or leftover pot roast can all be made into a
              delightful pie. Load it up in a casserole dish with a bunch
               of vegetables, top it with mashed potatoes, and bake it. 
               My mom used to have one of these loaded up in the freezer 
               for a quick, hearty dinner during the winter. 
            Braised Beef Short Ribs
             "Everything can be prepped ahead of time in stages,
              if needed, and then put into a crock-pot or Dutch oven. 
              You can walk away from it for several hours, and when you
             return you have succulent, tender beef ribs sitting in their
             own sauce. It's a comforting dish to prepare on a lazy,
             cold day off.

    <h3 class='title', id='chicken'>chicken</h3>
    <p>More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs.
       In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat,
       and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.
       The vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farms.
        According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74 percent of the world's poultry meat 
        and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.
         An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming.</p>

    <h3 class='title', id='sushi'>sushi</h3>
    <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, 
        usually with some sugar and salt, 
        accompanied by a variety of ingredients,
         such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. 
         Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, 
         but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", 
         also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.</p>
