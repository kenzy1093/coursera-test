    <p>In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them.
         Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically
          for the quality or quantity of their meat. 
          Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world,
           after pork and poultry. 
           As of 2018, the United States, Brazil 
           and China were the largest producers of beef.</p>

    <p>More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs.
       In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat,
       and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.
       The vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farms.
        According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74 percent of the world's poultry meat 
        and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.
         An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming.</p>
